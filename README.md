With these two powerful scripts (for Search and Shopping campaigns), we tackle non-Latin script search terms head-on. The scripts scan your search queries and automatically identify terms using non-Latin characters. If they don't match your target language criteria, the terms are moved to your exceptions list, ensuring your campaigns stay clean and focused.

ðŸš€ Note: This script is still in beta, so feel free to share your feedback and suggestions as we refine it further!
